# Introduction

A spirograph is a mathematical method of drawing geometric patterns. A large, hollow circle houses a smaller cirle, allowing it to rotate as it travels the inside edge of the circumference. A pen or other marker is placed at a point inside the smaller circle to draw as it rotates. This produces the geometric pattern we all love.

# Scope

I want to use the Turtle and Math libraries to create a programe which will replicate a spirograph.
The target outcomes are:

- save the output as an image file
- take arguments for inner radius
- take argument for where the marker should be along inner radius
- allow specification of the number of lines to draw
- generate lines in random colours

## nice to have

ability to specify other inner shapes

# Installation

## Requirements

This project repends on a few things... Number one is an isntallation of Python3.  
Some python modules - `turtle` and `tkinter` should be included in your installation. If not, use `pip` to install them.

## Usage

Running this programe should be simple, although I will bundle a .exe at a later date.  
To run, use the command `python main.py` from inside the project directory.  
Follow the command line prompts to specify details of your spirograph, and find outputted an .eps file. This can be opened and used in image processing software such as GIMP, Inkscape or Adobe.
